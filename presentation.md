It gives them the freedom to express all kinds of feelings, impressions, ideas
Слайд 4. 
And that freedom can be restricted only by two things — their skill level and their imagination.
Слайд 5. 
The situation in the web development world is similar.
Слайд 6. 
With the progress of HTML5 web developers have the ability to do things that were impossible in the past. 
Слайд 7. 
Drawing graphics and creating animations directly in the browser is now completely possible thanks to a HTML5 Canvas.

HTML5 Canvas advantages
Слайд 9. 
Interactivity. Canvas is fully interactive. It can respond to a user’s actions by listening for keyboard, mouse, or touch events.
Слайд 10. 
Animation. Every object drawn on the canvas can be animated. This allows for all levels of animations to be created, from simple bouncing balls to complex forward and inverse kinematics.
Слайд 11. 
Flexibility. Developers can create just about anything using canvas. It can display lines, shapes, text, images, video and audio
Слайд 12. 
Browser/Platform Support. HTML5 Canvas is supported by all major browsers and can be accessed on a wide range of devices 
Слайд 13. 
Popularity. The popularity of  canvas constantly remains quite high and has recently almost been compared with the popularity of flash
Слайд 14. 
It’s a web standard. Unlike Flash, Canvas is open technology that’s part of HTML5.
Слайд 15. 
Portability. HTML5 Canvas offers great portability. Once created a canvas application can run almost anywhere — from the largest computers to the smallest mobile devices.
Слайд 16. 
Free and accessible development tools. The basic tools for creating HTML5 canvas applications are just a browser and a code editor. Plus, there are many great and free libraries to help developers with canvas development.
Слайд 17. 
Basic Canvas Examples HTML5 Canvas let’s create many types of objects, including lines, curves, paths, shapes, text, etc. In the examples to follow you can see how some of these objects are actually drawn.
Слайд 18. 
Drawing lines
To draw a line, we use four canvas API methods. We start with the beginPath() method which instructs the browser to prepare to draw a new path. Next, we use the moveTo(x, y) method to set the line’s starting point. Then lineTo(x, y) method sets the ending point and draws the line by connecting the two points.
Слайд 19. 
Draw Rectangle
To draw a rectangle, we can use the fillRect(x, y, width, height) method to set the coordinates and the dimensions, along with the fillStyle property to set the fill color.
Слайд 20. 
Draw Text
To draw text on the canvas, we can use fillText(string, x, y) along with the font property to set the font, size, and style of the text (similar to font shorthand in CSS).

What Can You Create with HTML5 Canvas?
OK, canvas is great. But what exactly can use it for? Let’s see.
Слайд 22. 
Gaming. The HTML5 Canvas’ allows you to create various 2D and 3D games.
Слайд 23. 
Data Representation. HTML5 can collect data from global data sources and use it to generate visually appealing and interactive graphs and charts with the canvas element.
Слайд 24. 
Education and Training. HTML5 canvas can be used to produce effective and attractive learning experiences, combining text, images, videos, and audio.
Слайд 25. 
Art and Decoration. With a little bit of imagination and canvas’s wide variety of colors, gradients, patterns, transparency, shadows, and clipping features, all kinds of artistic and decorative graphics can be drawn.
Слайд 26. 
The examples provided in presentation don't cover all ways of using canvas, but should give you some clear ideas what you can do with it.
